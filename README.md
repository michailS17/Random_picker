# Random Picker

Random Picker is a simple JavaScript program that randomly picks a name from a list of names. This can be useful for selecting winners in a contest, or for any other scenario where you need to pick a random item from a list.


To use the Random Picker program follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your browser.
3. Enter the names you want to include in the list.
4. The program will randomly select a name from the list and display it.

Functionality
the functionality of the application is implemented using JavaScript. Specifically, it uses the Math.random() method to generate a random number between 0 and 1, which is then used to select a random item from the provided list.

DOM Manipulation used
document.getElementById()
document.querySelector()
document.createElement()
therefore, when the user clicks the "Pick Random Item" button, the application uses document.getElementById() to retrieve the list of items and then selects a random item from that list. It then creates a new HTML element using document.createElement() to display the selected item to the user.
